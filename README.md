## Quick Overview

You can get started in your own computer/cloud or you can also try it via your browser using [Google Colab](docs/GoogleColab.md).

It's very simple to setup 

```bash
 pip3 install mindsdb --user
```

Once you have MindsDB installed, you can use it as follows [(learn more)](docs/examples/basic/README.md):


To **train a model**:



```python

from mindsdb import *


# We tell mindsDB what we want to learn and from what data
MindsDB().learn(
    from_data="home_rentals.csv", # the path to the file where we can learn from, (note: can be url)
    predict='rental_price', # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file
    model_name='home_rentals' # the name of this model
)

```


To **use the model**:


```python

from mindsdb import *

# use the model to make predictions
result = MindsDB().predict(predict='rental_price', when={'number_of_rooms': 2,'number_of_bathrooms':1, 'sqft': 1190}, model_name='home_rentals')

# you can now print the results
print('The predicted price is ${price} with {conf} confidence'.format(price=result.predicted_values[0]['rental_price'], conf=result.predicted_values[0]['prediction_confidence']))

```
